# Migration log

## Yarn conversion

- Is DEFAULT_NPM_REGISTRY still needed?
- ESM dependencies (in node_modules) cause problems with jest. Configuration for
  js/ts esm/cjs jest/ts-jest/babel is infuriatingly complex ðŸ˜¤
- We need version plugin. Any side-effects of installing it on the fly?
- Possibly unneeded deps:
  - ~~tempy (only in --dev)~~
  - ~~rc~~
  - ~~normalize-url~~
  - codecov
  - nyc
  - ava
  - sinon

## TypeScript conversion

- `definitions/errors.ts` removed dynamic import of `package.json` (due to TS
  rootDir limitation with resolveJsonModule enabled)
- add `definitions/constants.ts` to hold constants
- add `definitions/context.ts` to TypeScript context types
  (@types/semantic-release were incomplete, might want to open PR to add to
  @types/semantic-release later)
- needed to refactor the set-npmrc-auth test since clear-module has no effect on
  esm code (seemingly)
- needed to add cache bust in dynamic esm import to integration test since
  clear-module has no effect on esm code (seemingly)

## Use `docker cp` for moving test/helpers/config.yaml

The Docker API `Binds` parameter doesn't work on certain environments (e.g. WSL)

## `Throws error if NPM token is invalid`

See
https://github.com/hongaar/semantic-release-yarn/pull/1/commits/a1458ba9a8c40c9d5438beb12e5567f182ed5c43

```
 âœ– Throws error if NPM token is invalid
  â”€

  Throws error if NPM token is invalid

  test/integration.test.js:103

   102:
   103:   const [error] = await t.throwsAsync(
   104:     t.context.m.verifyConditions(

  Promise resolved with:

  undefined

  â€º test/integration.test.js:103:27
```

Also happening on latest upstream, e.g.:
https://github.com/semantic-release/npm/actions/runs/3511912533/jobs/5883100863.
Seems only apparent on later Node version (16.x an later, but not on 16.0?)

Fixed with hacky workaround:

```
if (String(result.stdout).trim() === 'undefined') {
  throw new AggregateError([getError('EINVALIDNPMTOKEN', {registry})]);
}
```
